I'm from france, I'm currentyl learning JavaScript because I find fascinating what one can do with a computer, it's a limitless world. 

Sadly I was born into a family of people not believing in computer potential but they still use every day things like washing machines, refrigerators.. with softwares built by DEVS.

I'm finally setting ofF on a journey to learn how to program because I think of it very dearly! Now don't go proving me wrong !!

console.log('Hello, world!'); ----> //first line of code i ever wrote, makes me proud
